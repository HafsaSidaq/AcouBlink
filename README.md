# AcouBlink
We developed an acoustic eye blink detection system implemented on an HP ProBook 440 G5 laptop, utilizing its built-in speaker and microphone. During each experiment, reflected acoustic signals are captured to identify eye blinks, and the resulting data are compiled into a repository comprising 670 labeled samples.
